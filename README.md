## Introduction

The Robot Control System project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for controlling a robot remotely. The system consists of a Raspberry Pi mounted on the robot, which communicates with a web interface via WebSocket. The web interface allows users to control the robot's movements and view a live stream from a Foscam camera.

## Folders

- **CAD**: Contains CAD designs for the robot.
- **Raspberrypi-code**: Contains code for controlling the robot using a Raspberry Pi.
- **Website-code**: Contains code for the web interface.
- **Media**: Contains photos and videos of the robot in action.
- **Report**: Contains project documentation and reports.

## Features

- Remote control of the robot's movements (forward, backward, left, right).
- Live streaming from a Foscam camera.
- WebSocket communication between the Raspberry Pi and the web interface.
- User-friendly web interface for controlling the robot.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Website-code` folder and host the web interface on a web server.
3. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the same network as the web server.
4. Install the necessary dependencies on the Raspberry Pi.
5. Configure the WebSocket connection between the Raspberry Pi and the web interface.
6. Access the web interface from a browser and start controlling the robot.

## Usage

1. Open the web interface in a browser.
2. Use the control buttons to move the robot (forward, backward, left, right).
3. View the live stream from the Foscam camera.
4. Enjoy controlling the robot remotely!

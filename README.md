# UTRV-Mobile-Robot
This repository contains the project named "Unmanned Tracked Reconnaissance Vehicle (UTRV) Mobile Robot," made in the course ENR508 Mobile Robots Let Build One offered at Ahmedabad University. The project involves controlling a robot (tank-type) using a Raspberry Pi, along with a web interface for controlling the robot's movements and viewing a live stream from a Foscam camera.

## Overview

The UTRV-Mobile-Robot project involes a designing and building a mobile robot that is capable of remote controllling using a Raspberry Pi, along with a web interface for controlling the robot's movements and viewing a live stream from a Foscam camera.

## Components

### Mechanical Components (CAD Folder)
- CAD drawings and designs for the robot's chassis, motor mounts, and other mechanical parts.

### Electrical Components (RaspberryPi-code Folder)
- Raspberry Pi-based control system for communication with the motors, sensors, and camera.
- Python scripts for controlling motor movements, interacting with sensors, and streaming live video.

### Website Interface (Website-code Folder)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface hosted on a web server.
- Allows users to control the robot remotely, view live video feed, and change settings.

## Assembly

Follow the steps below to assemble the UTRV-Mobile-Robot:

1. **Base Plate Assembly**:
   - Take the base plate and affix all the L-section clamps, 2-hole angle clamps, and Motor L clamps onto it using M4 nuts and bolts.
   - Place the two side plates on both sides and attach them to the base plate with the L section and 2-hole angle clamps using M4 nuts and bolts.

2. **Motor Installation**:
   - Fix the 4 motors onto the base plate using C-clamps and support plates at their designated locations with M6 nuts and bolts.
   - Insert the sprocket shaft assembly into the motors and secure them using M4 grub screws.

3. **Top Plate and Rollers**:
   - Attach the remaining L-section clamps to the upper side of the side plate to mount the top plate using M4 nuts and bolts.
   - Install rollers onto the side plate at their dedicated positions using M12 nuts, bolts, and washers.

4. **Additional Components**:
   - Hammer the sprockets onto the sprocket shafts to secure them together through friction.
   - Fix the front and back brackets onto the side plate with M4 nuts and bolts.

5. **Final Assembly**:
   - Mount the FOSCAM onto the top plate using M6 bolts and nuts.
   - Secure the top plate onto the base assembly using M10 long bolts and M4 bolts attached to the L-section clamps.
   - Attach the front and back plates to the side plates using M3 screws.

6. **Completion**:
   - Once all components are assembled, the mobile robot is ready for use.

## Usage

1. Ensure all components are properly assembled and connected according to the provided instructions.
2. Power on the Raspberry Pi and connect it to the same Wi-Fi network as the controlling device (e.g., laptop, smartphone).
3. Access the web interface hosted on the Raspberry Pi's IP address using a web browser.
4. Use the interface to control the robot's movements, view the live video stream, and adjust settings as needed.
